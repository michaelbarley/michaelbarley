# Hey, I'm Michael

Data Engineer building real-time pipelines that ingest billions of events across 700+ ecommerce retailers. I work with Python, SQL, and TypeScript on AWS, and I automate everything I can with Terraform, Docker, and Kubernetes.

Currently at **Salesfire**, where I engineer a ClickHouse data warehouse at scale, built an identity resolution system with Neptune ML, and develop the data infrastructure behind AI-powered product recommendations serving millions of daily shoppers.
